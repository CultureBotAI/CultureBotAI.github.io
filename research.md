# Research Focus

CultureBotAI's research spans the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and microbiology, with a focus on transforming how we understand and manipulate microbial systems.

## Primary Research Areas

### ü¶† Cultivation of Isolated and Novel Organisms

We develop AI-powered approaches to successfully cultivate previously unculturable microorganisms. Our work focuses on:

- **Novel isolation techniques** guided by machine learning predictions
- **Automated culture monitoring** using computer vision and sensor networks  
- **Optimization of growth media** through iterative AI-driven experimentation
- **Scaling cultivation methods** from lab bench to industrial applications

**Key Challenges Addressed:**
- The "great plate count anomaly" - cultivating the 99% of microbes that resist standard cultivation
- Identifying optimal growth conditions for fastidious organisms
- Reducing time and resources required for successful cultivation

### üî¨ Culture Optimization Through Data-Driven Approaches

Our culture optimization research leverages big data and machine learning to dramatically improve cultivation success rates:

- **Environmental parameter optimization** (temperature, pH, oxygen, nutrients)
- **Media composition prediction** using metabolic network analysis
- **Co-culture design** for synthetic microbial communities
- **Contamination prevention** through predictive modeling

**Technologies Employed:**
- High-throughput screening platforms
- Automated liquid handling systems
- Real-time monitoring sensors
- Multi-objective optimization algorithms

### üß† Growth Preference Prediction Using AI/ML Methods

We develop sophisticated predictive models to understand and forecast microbial behavior:

#### Machine Learning Approaches
- **Deep neural networks** for complex pattern recognition in microbial data
- **Random forest models** for feature importance analysis
- **Support vector machines** for classification of growth outcomes
- **Ensemble methods** combining multiple predictive approaches

#### AI-Powered Prediction Systems
- **Metabolic network reconstruction** from genomic data
- **Environmental niche modeling** using ecological datasets
- **Growth curve prediction** from initial culture conditions
- **Optimal harvest timing** for maximum yield

**Data Integration:**
- Genomic and metagenomic sequences
- Environmental metadata
- Cultivation historical data
- Literature-derived growth parameters

## Knowledge Graph Development
