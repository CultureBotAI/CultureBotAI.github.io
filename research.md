# Research Areas ‚Äî AI and Machine Learning for Microbial Cultivation

**CultureBotAI's research is led by Dr. Marcin P. Joachimiak at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, focusing on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and microbiology.**

CultureBotAI's research spans the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and microbiology, with a focus on transforming how we understand and manipulate microbial systems through the KG-Microbe knowledge graph.

## Primary Research Areas

### ü¶† Cultivation of Isolated and Novel Organisms

We develop AI-powered approaches to successfully cultivate previously unculturable microorganisms. Our work focuses on:

- **Novel isolation techniques** guided by machine learning predictions
- **Automated culture monitoring** using computer vision and sensor networks  
- **Optimization of growth media** through iterative AI-driven experimentation
- **Scaling cultivation methods** from lab bench to industrial applications

**Key Challenges Addressed:**
- The "great plate count anomaly" - cultivating the 99% of microbes that resist standard cultivation
- Identifying optimal growth conditions for fastidious organisms
- Reducing time and resources required for successful cultivation

### üî¨ Culture Optimization Through Data-Driven Approaches

Our culture optimization research leverages big data and machine learning to dramatically improve cultivation success rates:

- **Environmental parameter optimization** (temperature, pH, oxygen, nutrients)
- **Media composition prediction** using computational approaches
- **Co-culture design** for synthetic microbial communities

**Technologies Employed:**
- High-throughput screening platforms
- Automated liquid handling systems
- Real-time monitoring sensors
- Multi-objective optimization algorithms
- Graph learning

### üß† Growth Preference Prediction Using AI/ML Methods

We develop sophisticated predictive models to understand and forecast microbial behavior:

#### Machine Learning Approaches
