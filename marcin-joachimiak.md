# Dr. Marcin P. Joachimiak — Principal Investigator

Dr. Marcin P. Joachimiak leads CultureBotAI and the development of KG-Microbe, a groundbreaking knowledge graph for microbiology research. As a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and member of the Berkeley Bioinformatics Open-source Projects (BBOP), Dr. Joachimiak bridges artificial intelligence and microbial cultivation to advance microbiological discoveries.

## Research Focus

Dr. Joachimiak's research centers on developing AI-powered solutions for microbial research, with particular emphasis on:

- **Knowledge Graph Development**: Leading the creation of KG-Microbe, a modular and scalable knowledge graph for microbiome and microbial sciences
- **AI for Cultivation**: Applying machine learning and artificial intelligence methods for growth preference prediction and culture optimization
- **Data Integration**: Developing frameworks for integrating diverse microbial data sources into unified, queryable knowledge systems
- **Ontology Development**: Creating standardized vocabularies like METPO (Microbial Experimental and Theoretical Preference Ontology) for microbiology research
