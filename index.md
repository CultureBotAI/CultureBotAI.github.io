# CultureBotAI â€” KG-Microbe Knowledge Graph for AI-Driven Microbial Cultivation ðŸ¦ 

Welcome to CultureBotAI - where artificial intelligence meets microbial cultivation through the [KG-Microbe knowledge graph](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-microbe) developed by [Dr. Marcin P. Joachimiak](https://biosciences.lbl.gov/profiles/marcin-joachimiak/).

## About Us

CultureBotAI develops AI-powered solutions for microbial research, cultivation, and analysis. We create intelligent tools that enhance laboratory workflows, optimize culture conditions, and accelerate microbiological discoveries.

**Principal Investigator:** [Dr. Marcin P. Joachimiak](https://biosciences.lbl.gov/profiles/marcin-p-joachimiak/) ([BBOP](https://berkeleybop.github.io/people/marcin-joachimiak/))  
**Laboratory:** [Environmental Genomics and Systems Biology Division](https://biosciences.lbl.gov/egsb/), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

## Our Focus

Our primary research areas include:
- **Cultivation of isolated and novel organisms**
- **Culture optimization** through data-driven approaches  
- **Growth preference prediction** using machine learning and AI methods
