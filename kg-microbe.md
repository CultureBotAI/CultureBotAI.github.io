# KG-Microbe â€” Knowledge Graph for Microbiology

**KG-Microbe is a comprehensive, modular knowledge graph for microbiology and microbiome research developed by Dr. Marcin P. Joachimiak at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California.**

## Overview

KG-Microbe is a comprehensive, modular knowledge graph designed specifically for microbiology and microbiome research. Developed by [Dr. Marcin P. Joachimiak](https://biosciences.lbl.gov/profiles/marcin-joachimiak/) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, this innovative resource integrates diverse microbial data sources to enable AI-driven insights for growth preference prediction and culture optimization.

## Key Features

### ðŸ§¬ Modular Architecture
- **Scalable Design**: Built with modularity in mind for easy expansion and maintenance
- **Flexible Integration**: Seamlessly incorporates new data sources and ontologies
- **Standardized Framework**: Uses consistent data models across all modules

### ðŸ¤– AI/ML Integration
- **Growth Preference Prediction**: Machine learning models trained on integrated knowledge graph data
- **Culture Optimization**: AI-driven recommendations for optimal cultivation conditions
- **Pattern Discovery**: Automated identification of microbial relationships and preferences

### ðŸ“Š Comprehensive Data Sources
- **Taxonomic Information**: Integrated microbial taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships
- **Growth Conditions**: Comprehensive collection of experimental growth parameters
- **Environmental Data**: Habitat and ecological context information
- **Genomic Features**: Integration with genomic and functional annotations

## Technical Architecture

### Data Integration Pipeline
KG-Microbe employs a sophisticated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that:
- Extracts data from multiple heterogeneous sources
- Transforms data using standardized ontologies and vocabularies
- Loads integrated data into a unified knowledge graph structure

### METPO Ontology
The **Microbial Experimental and Theoretical Preference Ontology (METPO)** provides:
- Standardized vocabulary for growth preferences
- Controlled terms for experimental conditions
- Hierarchical classification of microbial traits
- Semantic relationships between concepts

## Applications

### Research Applications
- **Cultivation Studies**: Predict optimal growth conditions for uncultured microbes
- **Comparative Microbiology**: Analyze growth patterns across different species
- **Ecological Modeling**: Understand microbial community dynamics
- **Biotechnology**: Optimize industrial cultivation processes

### AI/ML Use Cases
- **Predictive Modeling**: Train models to predict growth preferences
- **Recommendation Systems**: Suggest cultivation strategies
- **Knowledge Discovery**: Identify novel microbial relationships
- **Data Mining**: Extract patterns from large-scale microbial datasets

## Access and Usage

### Repository
- **GitHub**: [Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-microbe](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-microbe)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and API documentation
